## Welcome to Brendan + Sofiya's Travel Website

We will be leaving Vancouver, British Columbia, at the end of August (exact dates TBD) to embark on an indefinite travel adventure beginning in Europe. 

We are clearing out our (tiny) apartment, gathering all our stuff, putting it in storage and taking the rest in a couple of backpacks. Please come back to this page, initially to check out the [Link](url) "Items for Sale" page, and following our departure, to find out where we are and stay in touch through images and potentially blog posts. (Or just FaceTime us, damn it!)
