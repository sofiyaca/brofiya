                    <h3><strong>Why are you leaving?</strong></h3>
                    We are so fortunate to be able to embark on this adventure at a time in our lives when we don't yet have a family, a mortgage, or anything else that would tie us to a single location. We have talked about traveling for years and it would be foolish for us to pass up what is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <h3><strong>Where are you going?</strong></h3>
                    Our first series of stops will be in Europe, potentially until March 2019. Overall, our plans are very loose so come back to this site to see where we end up.
                    </p>

                    <h3><strong>How long will you be away?</strong></h3>
                    We don't know! We'll travel for a while, maybe settle down for a while, then maybe travel for a
                    while, and finally return to a permanent home in Canada.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <h3><strong>Will you be coming back?</strong></h3>
                    Yes! We will return home to Canada at the end of the trip, and it's also likely that we'll be back to
                    visit friends and family before then.
                    </p>
